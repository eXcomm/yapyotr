***WARNING*** ALPHA SOFTWARE! ***WARNING***

This is still in the late-alpha stage but I needed a place to put it - so why not put it up on GitHub? You will find that if you want to use it you'll have to hack at it. This came into existence as a sort of reference/debugging OTR implementation for another project I'm working on, so it's not polished (yet).

You need jabber.py and PyCrypto to get it working, as well as Python 2.5+ (probably?).

----

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
Proper DH key rotation
Revealing old MAC keys
Socialist Millionaire Protocol
Key fingerprinting
Proper DSA key loading
Proper DSA key generation
Any TLV-foo
Graceful disconnection

OK SO WHAT CAN I DO?
Authenticate
Send/recv encrypted messages

----

Let me know if you end up using this or playing with it, etc.  Patches/bug reports/questions/complaints/etc are welcomed.
